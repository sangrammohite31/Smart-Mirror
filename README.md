## Smart Mirror Application

### Overview

This project aims to create a smart mirror application using Raspberry Pi, incorporating speech recognition capabilities for user interaction. The mirror displays useful information such as weather updates, calendar events, and news, and responds to voice commands for user interaction.

### Setup Instructions

#### Step 1: Raspberry Pi Setup

1. Load Raspberry Pi OS onto a memory card and insert it into your Raspberry Pi.
2. Connect a screen and an Internet cable to your Raspberry Pi.
3. Use tools like Putty, Advanced IP Scanner, and RealVNC Viewer to access your Raspberry Pi remotely.
4. Open Putty and enter `raspberrypi.local` in the IP address field to connect.
5. Use the default login credentials: 
   - Username: `pi`
   - Password: `raspberrypi`.
6. Once logged in, run `sudo raspi-config`.
7. Navigate to the interface settings and enable VNC Viewer.
8. Use Advanced IP Scanner to scan for the Raspberry Pi's IP address if `raspberrypi.local` doesn't work.
9. Open RealVNC Viewer and connect using the Raspberry Pi's IP address.

#### Step 2: Speech Recognition Setup

1. Install the Speech Recognition library using pip: `pip install speechrecognition`.
2. If encountering errors, try creating a virtual environment: 
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv path/to/venv
   source path/to/venv/bin/activate
   ```
    It creates a virtual environment for Python, and then reinstall the package.
3. Install Python PyAudio library: `sudo apt install python-pyaudio`.
4. If PyAudio installation fails, try reinstalling: `pip install --force-reinstall pyaudio`.
5. If encountering `portaudio.h` error, install PortAudio development files: `sudo apt install portaudio-dev`.
6. If issues persist, update and upgrade ALSA: 
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade alsa-utils
   ```
7. If necessary, reinstall ALSA: `sudo apt-get install --reinstall alsa-utils`.
8. Install FLAC: `sudo apt-get install flac`.

#### Step 3: Electron JS Setup

1. Install Node.js and npm: `sudo apt install nodejs npm`.
2. Create a directory for your Electron app: `mkdir electron-app && cd electron-app`.
3. Initialize a new npm project: `npm init -y`.
4. Install Electron globally: `sudo npm install -g electron`.
5. Add a script to your package.json to start Electron: `"start": "electron ."`.

### Usage Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Run the Electron app: `npm start`.


### Additional Information

- Customize the Electron app to display personalized information on the smart mirror.
- Explore different modules and APIs to enhance functionality, such as integrating with weather APIs or calendar services.
- Experiment with voice commands to expand the range of interactions supported by the smart mirror.
- Regularly update dependencies and firmware to ensure optimal performance and security.
